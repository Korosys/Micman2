# Micman2
A dumb app to visually indicate via the system tray if my microphone is muted.

I don't know why you would use it but it changes the tray icon when run the exe with either:

--muted or --unmuted

I use voicemeeter macrobuttons to actually mute and unmute, which also changes the icon.

i have no idea what im doing
